Project: Automated Nerf Turret with Facial Tracking
Overview:
Designed and implemented an automated Nerf turret capable of shooting foam bullets with precision targeting using facial tracking technology. The project featured a user-friendly interface allowing seamless toggling between AI-driven facial tracking and manual control via a controller.

Software Implementation:
Facial Tracking with OpenCV: Integrated computer vision capabilities using OpenCV to enable facial tracking. This feature allows the turret to automatically aim at detected faces.
User Interface with Tkinter: Developed a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter, providing users with a seamless platform to toggle between AI-driven facial tracking and manual control.
Manual Control using Pygame: Incorporated Pygame for joystick input, enabling users to operate the turret manually using a controller for an interactive experience.
Wireless Communication with PySerial: Implemented PySerial for reliable and efficient wireless communication between the laptop and the HC-05 module.
Radio communication Using Arduino IDE: Utilized Arduino IDE to send data to and from the HC-05 modules.

Hardware Components:
Microcontroller: Implemented the project using an Arduino Nano, serving as the central control unit for the turret's hardware.
Wireless Communication: Established communication between the turret and a laptop using the HC-05 radio module for real-time data exchange.
